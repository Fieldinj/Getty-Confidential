# Forged or Authentic? 



# Objects in Focus 

The statue Kouros was bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1986 for 9 million dollars. The Getty Museum defines this statue as a representation of youth itself. As pictured, the statue depicts a nude youth and was used as a dedication to the gods. These statues would be found in sanctuaries and as grave monuments throughout Archaic Greece. 

This statue has caused some controversy for the Getty museum as it has been in many debates regarding its authenticity. Many different arguments have been stated on why exactly this statue is forged. Some speculate that the statue is forged because of a chemical process that is shown on the exterior.  This has caused the statue to slowly erode over time. Scientists argued that this chemical process was caused by potato mold that was only a few months old rather than years. Further investigation has shown that the curator that presented the kouros had forged the documents for the statue. Another argument has stated that the material used for the sculpture was too “new” and the marble was in great condition for it to be thousands of years old. The features on the sculpture have also been questioned as they seem to mix between time periods. The Getty museum also states that because of where the marble is from, this has caused people to question its age. 

The Fragmentary Imitation Kouros was found in 1990 by [Jeffrey Spier](https://getty.academia.edu/JeffreySpier/CurriculumVitae). Jeffrey Spier had thought he figured out the solution when he discovered another fragmentary statue. He believed that because both the statues showed the same features, they were made by the same hand. Then he deducted that because of this, they are both forged. This claim was then debunked because scholars revealed that there are markings from modern tools that were not one the Getty Kouros. Although the fragmentary kouros is found to be officially fake, it helps prove the authenticity for the Getty kouros. As mentioned before, the modern tool markings were not found on the Getty kouros and further research has helped prove ancient tool usage on the statue. The Getty museum had acquired the fragmentary kouros for research and have used it for further research on the kouros statue.
