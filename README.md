# Forged or Authentic?



# The Getty Kouros

[The kouros statue](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103vnp) owned by the [J. Paul Getty Museum](https://www.getty.edu/museum/) was purchased in 1986 for $9 million. As pictured, the statue depicts a nude youth and was used as a dedication to the gods. Kouros statues similar to this piece would be found in sanctuaries and as grave monuments throughout Archaic Greece.

The sculpture dates from 530 B.C. but is suspected to be a more [modern forgery](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-crime-of-forgery-970864). The museum’s online entry describes how the kouros embodies many different ideals from the aristocratic culture of Ancient Greece. They define this statue as a representation of youth itself. <q>One such ideal of this period was *arete*, a combination of moral and physical beauty and nobility. Arete was closely connected with 
       *kalos kagathos*, a composite term for beautiful, good, or noble.</q> In the sixth century B.C. these statues epitomised society’s value on youth and male beauty.

# The Fragmentary Imitation Kouros

In 1990, art historian [Jeffrey Spier](https://getty.academia.edu/JeffreySpier/CurriculumVitae) discovered pieces of a kouros statue that have since become collectively known as the [Fragmentary Imitation Kouros](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103WHK). This kouros was quickly identified as a forgery, but Spier believed it provided critical insight for the aforementioned Getty Kouros. He argued that the similarities in characteristics and art style between the two pieces proved the illegitimacy of each kouros, finally ending the debate on authenticity. Taking this into account, scholars immediately began research on the possibility of the statues sharing a creator, but were quick to discard the idea. The Fragmentary Imitation Kouros was deduced to have been manufactured by modern tools, while the style in which the Getty Kouros was erected remained consistent with the targeted time frame it should have been assembled in. Since the controversy, the Getty museum has obtained the Fragmentary Kouros as well in order to use it as a subject for studying modern forgeries of artifacts.

In 1992, the Getty Museum hosted an event in Greece in an attempt to publicly open up the debate to experts worldwide. Transporting the statue to Athens, nineteen experts in classical Greek artifacts were called to provide their collective insight on the topic. Despite compelling arguments from both points of view, the group was unable to come to a common consensus, and the Getty Kouros’ authenticity remains unsolved. The Getty Museum’s online entry explains that there is no exact conclusion to this issue, and while it does not specifically state that the statue is forged, it does acknowledge that the organization has limited knowledge on the subject of Greek sculpture. Therefore, the label ‘dated about 530 B.C. or modern forgery’ was used.
