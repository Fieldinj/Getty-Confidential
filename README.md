# Introduction and Background

The statue Kouros was bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1986 for 9 million dollars. The Getty Museum defines this statue as a representation of youth itself. As pictured, the statue depicts a nude youth and was used as a dedication to the gods. These statues would be found in sanctuaries and as grave monuments throughout Archaic Greece. 
This statue has caused some controversy for the Getty museum as it has been in many debates regarding its authenticity. Many different arguments have been stated on why exactly this statue is forged. Some speculate that the statue is forged because of a chemical process that is shown on the exterior.  This has caused the statue to slowly erode over time. Scientists argued that this chemical process was caused by potato mold that was only a few months old rather than years. Another argument has stated that the material used for the sculpture was too “new” and the marble was in great condition for it to be thousands of years old. The features on the sculpture have also been questioned as they seem to mix between time periods. The Getty museum also states that because of where the marble is from, this has caused people to question its age. 
While these arguments sound very compelling, the Getty museum has stated in their short online entry that there is no exact conclusion to this issue. They do not specifically state that the statue is forged, but they do acknowledge that they have limited knowledge on the subject of Greek sculpture.

## Our Thoughts?

We now see this kouros as a piece of art in its own right. If it is a forgery, it is an immensely skilled done by an artist who used a pastiche of stylistic details that deserve study. The locks of hair suggest early sixth century B.C. but the sensitively modelled feet and abdomen suggest a later date. The muscle detail in the thighs suggest kouroi from Corinth but the narrow shoulders do not look archaic. We even held a colloquium in Athens with the help of our friends as the [Museum of Cycladic Art](https://cycladic.gr/en) with the world’s leading experts to discuss their views on the statue and shared the findings with you.
So when a similar, unquestionably [fake torso](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103WHK) turned up we bought it so that our research laboratories could do more tests involving independent scholars and scientists. And yet we are still no further in uncovering the truth. It seems that scientific opinion is not mightier than aesthetic judgement.
But we made a mistake in removing the now infamous Getty Kouros from our galleries recently. And we will return it alongside the Fragmentary Kouros so that we can fully share the enigma with you and our visitors. We plan to have some fun with it and ask you to help us develop this permanent exhibition. So what can we do together to create a witty celebration of risk, and passion for artistry. Let’s use [Martin Kersel’s](https://ocula.com/artists/martin-kersels/) series of photographs of himself clutching a life-size replica of the Kouros that he did back 2000 as a starting point and start a true collaboration.
